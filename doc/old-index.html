RunQ</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>

<p><br>RunQ is a computer performance management tool. It is designed to
provide IT professionals with a simple tool to keep track of the usage
of their computer resources. It can be used to keep track of daily performance
data and/or to do specific performance or capacity studies.
<p>This version contains the performance collector and data analyzer. Also
a perl script is provided to show how to use the tool to store daily performance
data in a RDBMS. The CVS output can also be imported into spreadsheets
for manipulation and graphing.
<p>As development carries on, more functionality's will be provided and
global quality will enhance. But as for today, this software is still <b>BETA</b>
and should be used as so. More information on how to use RunQ for specific
tasks can be found in a not yet published document.
<p>Currently it is only available on Sparc Solaris 2.6, Sparc Solaris 2.7,
Intel Solaris 8 and Intel Linux 2.2 platform. Future versions are in development.

At the time of writing a major Belgian mobile operator is using this tool
to evaluate the performance of their under development software. It already
successfully identified performance issues and by fixing a single line
of code boosted the performance of one of their applications.

Download RunQ</h2>

<h3>
A Linux version of RunQ can be downloaded at</h3>
<a href="http://web.wanadoo.be/rc.s/downloads/RunQ/linux-2.x/runq-1.5.tgz">http://web.wanadoo.be/rc.s/downloads/RunQ/linux-2.x/runq-1.5.tgz</a>.
<p>This version should runs on linux 2.2 with glibc (RedHat and compatibles
Suse, Mandrake, ...) on a the Intel platform. It has only been tested on
a mono PentiumII laptop with Mandrake 7.0.
<p>Mandrake users could encountered problems due to the higher security.
They will only see their own processes <i>($ runq procs)</i>. It is then
adviced to run RunQ as root.
<p>The previous public version failed to run on RedHat systems because
the location of libraries on CorelLinux differ, as a side effect this version
won't run on CorelLinux.
<h3>
A SPARC Solaris versions of RunQ can be downloaded at</h3>

<h4>Solaris 2.6 and 2.7</h4>
<a href="http://web.wanadoo.be/rc.s/downloads/RunQ/GCC-sparc-solaris2.7/runq-1.5.tgz">http://web.wanadoo.be/rc.s/downloads/RunQ/GCC-sparc-solaris2.7/runq-1.5.tgz</a>.
